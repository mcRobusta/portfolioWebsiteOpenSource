Fetching real-time stock data is surprisingly hard! APIs exist, but sadly so do people trying to rip you off with extortionate licenses.

I found a Python module that scrapes data from Yahoo Finance and used a (free) Vercel serverless function to turn this module into an API 
that I can call from my website.
