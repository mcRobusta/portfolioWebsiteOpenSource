    `Financial market crashes are part and parcel of our post-globalised world, and many experts view them as essential for a robust economy. Whilst they are uncontrollable, they can be forecasted using topology (the "study of surfaces"). A "Topologist" sees a flat piece of paper and a rolled piece of paper as the same thing, while a geometrist would say "hey, that's not a rectangle anymore, that's a cylinder!". Ripping the page alters its topology, but only if you take pleasure in making two mathematicians cry.
    
    What if we consider the correlations between stocks as a surface? During a financial crash, no one escapes- everyone's stocks go down. Surely, there must be a noticeable difference between the 'normal' surface of chaos that is stock trading and the universal drop that is a crash, right?
    
    On the right, you'll see the stocks within the Dow Jones Industrial Average connected together to make a 2D surface. The colour of each connection indicates how strong the correlation between the two stocks is (brighter is stronger). This simulation is running data between January 2008-January 2009. Press the button to see it in action!
    
    Can you spot when the infamous September 29th, 2008 financial crash occurs?`,

    `It wouldn't be any fun if you couldn't input your own data.
    
    Enter any NYSE ticker (<a href="https://www.nyse.com/listings_directory/stock" target="_blank">here's a list</a>) followed by a newline to draw your own custom topology. You can also edit the date range of stock data in the box above. This website is actually fetching live NYSE stock data, so you can go all the way up to today. 
    
    Why not analyse another market crash, like the one in March 2020?`,

    `This visualisation lets us see financial crashes very clearly, but what's even more amazing is topology lets us predict financial crashes based on previous correlation data.
    
    Using a technique called persistent homology, we can filter out correlations below a certain threshold and analyse the resulting shape. Astonishingly, this gives us a really strong idea as to whether a given portfolio is approaching a 'significant global shift', which means the portfolio is about to go up or down drastically. This isn't a perfect science as the stock market is all but random, however with the help of machine learning and some correlation analysis we can obtain some surprisingly solid results.
    
    I connected a model trained on this extracted data to this website- enter a stock portfolio of your choice, and get a topology-based prediction of whether it's about to experience a significant global shift.`

          Well, this is what colour actually is! Colour is just a wavelength of light, and
          smaller wavelength makes more "blue" colours. This 1D scale can be used to convert
          small numbers into blue-y colours and larger numbers into red-ish colours.
        * Breaking down a colour into its RGB components makes this process very simple. 
          I use some vector maths to work out the transformation needed to go from one
          colour to another (say, from purple to yellow) and then I add the transformation
          multiplied by the correlation to the base colour and get a result. If the correlation
          is 0.5, then my colour is halfway between purple and yellow. If it's 0.25, it's 
          one quarter yellow, three quarters purple.
